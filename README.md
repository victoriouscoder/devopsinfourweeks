# devopsinfourweeks



There has never been a better time to launch your DevOps career, and this 4-week course provides the training and knowledge you need to get started. This series explores the concepts you need to learn, but more than that, helps you build your own skills through homework assignments and doing the actual work needed to truly gain proficiency.

Week 1 introduces you to core DevOps technologies and details how DevOps has influenced the way applications are offered. You learn about configuration as code, working with Git, CI/CD, containers, microservices, and other core DevOps technologies so you can best understand why all of these work so well together.

Week 2 focuses on jumpstarting your containers knowledge and skills. You explore microservices and then jump into both the Docker approach and Podman. You also learn how to package your application in an image, which you can then run as a container.

Week 3 is all about Kubernetes. Thereâ€™s a lot to explore on this topic, and we start with detailing how to bring containers to the data center. Running stand-alone containers is nice, but running containers as a cluster is more efficient and scalable and allows you to build your microservices solution so you can avoid headaches down the road.

In Week 4 you learn about OpenShift, the platform that brings it all together. In OpenShift you integrate your Git-based CI/CD pipelines and work with YAML to manifest files to automate the build process from source code to an application, running as a container in your data center.
What you'll learn-and how you can apply it

At the end of this live, hands-on, online course you'll be able to:

    Run your source code as an application in a container
    Connect multiple containers together in a microservice
    Scale and orchestrate container workloads in Kubernetes
    Automatically build applications from source code and run them in OpenShift

This training course is for you because...

    You are a developer who wants to learn all about running applications as containers
    You are a systems administrator who wants to know how to do sysadmin work in the era of containers
    You're looking for an easy way to automate the application build process

Prerequisites

    Basic knowledge about Linux is recommended.

Course Set-up

    For weeks 1 and 2 of this course, students are recommended to use two virtual machines. One virtual machine that has a standard installation of Ubuntu LTS 20.04 workstation, and another virtual machine that has a minimal installation of CentOS 8.x. Additional setup instructions can be found in the course github repository 
    https://github.com/sandervanvugt/devopsinfourweeks
    
    For week 3 of this course, access to a Kubernetes cluster is required. Setup of Kubernetes is explained in week 2 of the course. To run a Kubernetes cluster based on Minikube, students will need to use Ubuntu LTS 20.04 workstation with at least 4GB of RAM
    For week 4 of this course, running a virtual machine with OpenShift is required. The OpenShift virtual machine needs a minimum of 9 GB of RAM. Setup instructions will be provided in week

Recommended Preparation

    You should have an understanding of Linux basics before taking this course. Please take a look at my video course Linux Fundamentals if you need to hone your skills before the class.
